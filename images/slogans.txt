400 miles a gallon.
A bike ride a day keeps the doctor away.
Bicycling is better for your body, mind, wallet and world.
Bicyclists make better lovers!
Bikes ARE traffic.
Burn Carbohydrates, Not Hydrocarbons.
Burn fat, Not oil.
Cars Kill, Bikes Thrill.
Curb your car.
End the Oil-igarchy.
Four wheels move the body. Two wheels move the soul.
Friends Don’t Let Friends Drive.
Get a bike, get a life.
Grasp life by the handlebars.
Half the wheels, twice the fun!
Have fun.
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to a bike.
LIVE FREE or DRIVE!
Live longer.
Lose weight.
Love America? Ride a bike.
Make friends.
Make love, not exhaust.
Mend your fuelish ways.
My other car is a bike.
No concealed weapons.
One less car.
Powered by pancakes.
Put something fun between your legs.
Put the fun between your legs.
S.U.V. spells dick.
Save money.
Save the Earth, ride a bike.
Save the world.
So long oil, and thanks for all the civilization.
Stay alive, don’t drive.
Style over speed.
Thank you for not driving (in the bike lane).
The revolution will not be motorized.
Think globally, cycle locally.
Those that can, do; those that can’t, drive.
Yes we can use less oil.
You’d look sexier on a bike.
Your car makes you look fat.
